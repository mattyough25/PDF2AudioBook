IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 2 of 9 neuromusc ular activity  of the arm  to shed light on  the  larger question of  how the nervous  system  compensates  for g ravity  during performance of skilled tasks .  Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2. Material and methods    2.1 Experimental  Procedure   Seve n healthy participant s (27.4 ± 4.6 years, 5  males) were recruited for this study. The study protocol   was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  West Virginia University (Protocol  #1311129283 ).  Participant s were include d if they presen ted no s erious disea se or d isorder that could af fect mo vements of the  arm and d id not consu me any medication that could  affect movements of the arm. All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task.

The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant . A repeated -measures ANOVA  was applied  to the dataset usin g the fitrm () in MATLAB . The model  contained  one within -subject fac tor (Gender)  and one  between subject factor  (Task with 3 l evels for VR,  Light, and Heavy  tasks).

Introduction   Hum an motor control involves  complex interactio ns  between the neural control signals , biomechanical  properties of the limbs , and external forces  such as  gravity  [1]. Movement in microgravity poses unique  challenges especially for  highly skilled manual tasks   that requir e control of devices  or manipulation of  objects  with complex dynami cs. We know  that human  sensorimotor performan ce can deteriorate  by as much as  50% at the initial onset of exposure to a microgravity  environment.  The velocity  trajector ies and muscl e  activity  of reaching  movements  are mildly affected  in  the short -term exposure to mi crogravity and  hypergravity , chan ges that  can quickly resolve  [2], [3] .  However , highly skilled  movements , like surgical  suturing , were  associated with greater  deficits  in  microgravity . This results  in increased  applied forces  and decrea sed accuracy and ef ficiency of movement  compared to the perform ance in normal  gravity  [4]–[6].  Therefore, understanding how the nervous system   compensates for the complex limb a nd object dynamics   in skilled  movements  will hel p us quantify the  performance deficits in microgravity and find methods  to mi tigate them.   The most accepted theory in  the field of  motor  control that explains how our brains  compensate  for  complex limb and external dynamics  is based on  the  idea of in ternal  model s [7]–[14]. The internal models  assist in the generation of co ntrol signals and provide  reference for the expec ted sensory feedback to de tect  mismat ch. For examp le, fo rward models  can compute  propriocepti ve feedback originating in muscle spindles  and Golgi tendon organ s from the efferen t copy of the  motor command . Th e mis match between sensed and  predicted signals can initiate a  sensorimoto r adaptati on  to improve  task performance  [15]. Conversely, inverse  models implement  desired consequences into actions ,  constraining  the outcome of control solut ions. These  models are optimized  through  the lifetime of  motor  learning  to perform  in the Earth’s gravita tional  environment . Therefore , the deficit  of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between the  interna l neural expectati ons of the forces caused by  gravity acting on  the limb d uring movemen t and object  manip ulation an d the  lack o f those forces in  microgravity . Here , we conducted a pilot study of how  the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 2 of 9 neuromusc ular activity  of the arm  to shed light on  the  larger question of  how the nervous  system  compensates  for g ravity  during performance of skilled tasks .  Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2. Material and methods    2.1 Experimental  Procedure   Seve n healthy participant s (27.4 ± 4.6 years, 5  males) were recruited for this study. The study protocol   was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  West Virginia University (Protocol  #1311129283 ).  Participant s were include d if they presen ted no s erious disea se or d isorder that could af fect mo vements of the  arm and d id not consu me any medication that could  affect movements of the arm. All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task. In the left panel, t he participa nt is  seated and wearing a VR helmet. Black boxes on the  arm are wirel ess EMG sensors. The VR view in the  right panel shows the green block about to be placed on  the target (black circle with red cr oss).73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 3 of 9   The physical  BBT  was also built using the  specifie d  dimensions  (Fig. 2). To match the VR task  and  minimize inter -trial and int er-participant  variability , the  real-world BBT was also simplified to picki ng up a  single  3D-printed  block , which was  instrument ed with a  force sensor  (FSR , Trigno by Delsys ) for the detect ion  of contac t forces . Participants were  asked to pick up the  block , move it from left to right over the div iding  wall,  place it on the other side of the bo x, then move it back ,  and repeat this  20 times. During each  placement,  participan ts were as ked to a im for to the  same location   on the  table . Participants  performed the task twice –  once with a light block ( 0.02 kg, Light task ) and on ce  with a heavy block ( 0.11 kg, Heavy task).      Fig. 2. Experimental  Setup of the physical BBT . The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant .

Post-hoc t ests between the  levels of the Ta sk factor  were conducted using the  multcompa re() in MATLAB  and comp ared with  the  Sidak -Bonferoni corr ection for multiple comparison s (  = 0.017 ).  The data in Resul ts are reported as  means  per task    standard deviations  across  participants  unless otherwise  indicated .    4. Resul ts   All p articipants  succeeded  in perform ing the three tasks  in a consistent mann er. During the physical BBT task,  the force sensors  provided reliable timing of grasp and  release of the block by the particip ants (Fig. 3A ). There  were no differen ces between  the level s of grip force   between the H eavy task (8  7 % max pressure)  and the  Light task (8  9 % max pressure ; t = 0.18, p = 0.87).  All recorded  movements  were  accompanied by  contractions of both flexors and extensors  of the hand   (Fig. 3B) . Muscle activations were  generall y lower  during  the VR task with no physical block to  manipula te, which  trans lated to lower co-contraction  values  (Fig. 3C, black line ). During the Light and Heavy  tasks,  the EMG activ ity of both flexors and extensors   increase d comp ared to the VR task . This resulted in  increased  co-contra ction values during the Light  and  Heavy tasks compare d to the VR task (Fig. 3C , blue and  red). This pattern was consistent across all participants   despite the high inter -subject variab ility in the levels of  individual  co-contraction  estimate s across tasks (Fig. 4).       Fig. 3.

Coloured bars show   average s and whiskers  show st andard dev iations  across  20 block trans fers in each task. The co-contrac tion  between  FCR and ECR  muscles  was al ways the lowest  in the VR task in all participan ts.     This pattern was also consi stent across all muscle  pairs studied here , even in the bice ps and tric eps  muscles that  do not sp an the wrist and fi ngers and  are  typically thought to not be involved in object  manipulation directly  (Fig. 5). Overall , the co- contraction levels were diffe rent across conditions for  all antagonistic muscle pair combin ations ( F(1,1) = 25.4,  p = 0.004 ). There were no differe nces between  participants  of different gender  (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.471 ),  although the participant  pool was small.  The co- contraction  value s during the  VR task were  the lowest  in all pairs of muscl es (Fig. 5; Heavy – VR = 0.0 46   0.009, p = 0.008, significa ntly differe nt). The co- contraction val ues during the Light task were  most often  intermediate betwee n Heavy  and VR tasks , so that the re  were  no significan t difference s between these  tasks  across all m uscle pairs  and participants ( Light  – VR =  0.039   0.010 , p = 0.023 ; Light – Heavy = -0.006   0.007 , p = 0.613 ).   Similar  results were a lso obtai ned using t he total co- contractio n metric  (Fig. 6). The total co -contraction  between all flexors and extensors was differe nt across  tasks  (F(1,1) = 23.8, p = 0.005), but not across genders\n",

The internal models  assist in the generation of co ntrol signals and provide  reference for the expec ted sensory feedback to de tect  mismat ch. For examp le, fo rward models  can compute  propriocepti ve feedback originating in muscle spindles  and Golgi tendon organ s from the efferen t copy of the  motor command . Th e mis match between sensed and  predicted signals can initiate a  sensorimoto r adaptati on  to improve  task performance  [15]. Conversely, inverse  models implement  desired consequences into actions ,  constraining  the outcome of control solut ions. These  models are optimized  through  the lifetime of  motor  learning  to perform  in the Earth’s gravita tional  environment . Therefore , the deficit  of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between the  interna l neural expectati ons of the forces caused by  gravity acting on  the limb d uring movemen t and object  manip ulation an d the  lack o f those forces in  microgravity . Here , we conducted a pilot study of how  the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2. Material and methods    2.1 Experimental  Procedure   Seve n healthy participant s (27.4 ± 4.6 years, 5  males) were recruited for this study. The study protocol   was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  West Virginia University (Protocol  #1311129283 ).  Participant s were include d if they presen ted no s erious disea se or d isorder that could af fect mo vements of the  arm and d id not consu me any medication that could  affect movements of the arm. All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task. In the left panel, t he participa nt is  seated and wearing a VR helmet. Black boxes on the  arm are wirel ess EMG sensors. The VR view in the  right panel shows the green block about to be placed on  the target (black circle with red cr oss).73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 3 of 9   The physical  BBT  was also built using the  specifie d  dimensions  (Fig. 2). To match the VR task  and  minimize inter -trial and int er-participant  variability , the  real-world BBT was also simplified to picki ng up a  single  3D-printed  block , which was  instrument ed with a  force sensor  (FSR , Trigno by Delsys ) for the detect ion  of contac t forces . Participants were  asked to pick up the  block , move it from left to right over the div iding  wall,  place it on the other side of the bo x, then move it back ,  and repeat this  20 times. During each  placement,  participan ts were as ked to a im for to the  same location   on the  table . Participants  performed the task twice –  once with a light block ( 0.02 kg, Light task ) and on ce  with a heavy block ( 0.11 kg, Heavy task).      Fig. 2. Experimental  Setup of the physical BBT . The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant . A repeated -measures ANOVA  was applied  to the dataset usin g the fitrm () in MATLAB . The model  contained  one within -subject fac tor (Gender)  and one  between subject factor  (Task with 3 l evels for VR,  Light, and Heavy  tasks). A separate  repeated-measures   ANOVA  with the same structure  was applied  to the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Post-hoc t ests between the  levels of the Ta sk factor  were conducted using the  multcompa re() in MATLAB  and comp ared with  the  Sidak -Bonferoni corr ection for multiple comparison s (  = 0.017 ).  The data in Resul ts are reported as  means  per task    standard deviations  across  participants  unless otherwise  indicated .    4. Resul ts   All p articipants  succeeded  in perform ing the three tasks  in a consistent mann er. During the physical BBT task,  the force sensors  provided reliable timing of grasp and  release of the block by the particip ants (Fig. 3A ). There  were no differen ces between  the level s of grip force   between the H eavy task (8  7 % max pressure)  and the  Light task (8  9 % max pressure ; t = 0.18, p = 0.87).  All recorded  movements  were  accompanied by  contractions of both flexors and extensors  of the hand   (Fig. 3B) . Muscle activations were  generall y lower  during  the VR task with no physical block to  manipula te, which  trans lated to lower co-contraction  values  (Fig. 3C, black line ). During the Light and Heavy  tasks,  the EMG activ ity of both flexors and extensors   increase d comp ared to the VR task . This resulted in  increased  co-contra ction values during the Light  and  Heavy tasks compare d to the VR task (Fig. 3C , blue and  red). This pattern was consistent across all participants   despite the high inter -subject variab ility in the levels of  individual  co-contraction  estimate s across tasks (Fig. 4).       Fig. 3.

Coloured  lines show   the filtered profiles for  one of the  force sensors  located on the block  (A), rectified EMG  envelopes  of ECU and  FCU muscles  (B), and co-contraction between them (C)   during each task condit ion.     Fig. 4. Co-contraction between  FCR and ECR  muscles   per task  for eac h participant . Coloured bars show   average s and whiskers  show st andard dev iations  across  20 block trans fers in each task. The co-contrac tion  between  FCR and ECR  muscles  was al ways the lowest  in the VR task in all participan ts.     This pattern was also consi stent across all muscle  pairs studied here , even in the bice ps and tric eps  muscles that  do not sp an the wrist and fi ngers and  are  typically thought to not be involved in object  manipulation directly  (Fig. 5). Overall , the co- contraction levels were diffe rent across conditions for  all antagonistic muscle pair combin ations ( F(1,1) = 25.4,  p = 0.004 ). There were no differe nces between  participants  of different gender  (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.471 ),  although the participant  pool was small.  The co- contraction  value s during the  VR task were  the lowest  in all pairs of muscl es (Fig. 5; Heavy – VR = 0.0 46   0.009, p = 0.008, significa ntly differe nt). The co- contraction val ues during the Light task were  most often  intermediate betwee n Heavy  and VR tasks , so that the re  were  no significan t difference s between these  tasks  across all m uscle pairs  and participants ( Light  – VR =  0.039   0.010 , p = 0.023 ; Light – Heavy = -0.006   0.007 , p = 0.613 ).   Similar  results were a lso obtai ned using t he total co- contractio n metric  (Fig. 6). The total co -contraction  between all flexors and extensors was differe nt across  tasks  (F(1,1) = 23.8, p = 0.005), but not across genders73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

The total co-contract ion levels  during the  VR task were  the lowest in all individuals   (Fig. 6; Heavy – VR = 0.010  0.002, p = 0.017,  significantly dif ferent). During the  Light task , the total  co-contract ion levels  were intermediate  (Light  – VR =  0.007  0.002, p = 0.02 9; Light  – Heavy  = -0.002   0.001, p = 0.286). Overall, th ese data shows that  the co - contraction of antagonistic muscles changes the most   when a physical object is present . It is also sensitive  to  the weight of the object being manipulated , but to a  lesser degree .    5. Discussion    Results show  that the co-contraction levels  of all  pairs of antagonistic muscle s and between  all flexors  and ext ensors  were  the highest  in the task with the  heav iest object and they were the lowest  in the  VR task.  This was contrary to the expectations of higher co - contractio n levels in the VR and Light task s. Thi s may  be due to the incorrect assumption  that the move ments  with lighter objects  or with no objects  are inhere ntly  less stable than the movements with the heav ier objects .  The validity of this assumption will be teste d in future  studies evaluating  how the interaction torques are  altered by the object  weig ht. Movements with a ssistive  interacti on torques , which  amplify the muscle torques  that cause  movement , have been shown to be  accompanied by increased co -contraction [41], [42] . It  is possible that objects with heavier  weight may further  amplify the assistive interactio n torques , and t hus  require increased co -contraction.  This idea, if true,  may  have  an interesting applicatio n for mainta ining  muscle  function while living and  working in microgravity . For  example, making  objects  that the astronauts  interact  with daily  heavier may increase  their muscle co - contraction and help reduce muscle  and bone wasting in  microgravity.    Our data also show that  movements in VR with no  physical  object  were accompanied  by consistent ly lower  co-contrac tion compared to  that during  movements w ith  real objects . While the visual feedback  was alike  during   the VR and real-world task s, the proprioceptive  and  haptic  feedba ck was clearly different .  We know that  both vision and proprioception  are important  for  defining the amplitude and direction of  reaching  [43]– [45] and for hand pre -shaping prior to object grasp [46],  [47]. Other c lassical studies with people who lost large- fibre  afferent feedback have shown that moveme nts  under only visu al control are slower and less accurate   [48], [49]  and that the muscle contractions are  sustainable  only with visual fee dback  [50]. Furthermore,  the corticosp inal control of hand  muscles is increased  around the time of object c ontact [51].  More r ecently, it  has been shown that t he alteration of sensory feedba ck  through  media n nerve paresthaesia  in healthy  participants  alters both  the reaching  for the object  and the grasping  forces  during object ma nipulation  [52].  Conversely,  the presence of haptic  feedback  in VR tasks   has been shown to strengthen  the perception of  immersive ness when compared to visual feedback alone   [53], [54] . This suggests that the reduced co -contraction  during our VR task may be due to  the altered   propri ocept ive feedbac k from the  missing  object weight   and the missing  haptic feedback from the contact with  the object . Therefore,  the training  in virtual re ality may  be more effective with better  carry over to the real - world skills when it is supplemented  with appropriate  haptic feedback  and potentially proprioceptive fee dback  through the use of robotic  exoskeletons  that would  simulate the changes in loads expected from the altered  gravity environment .

Introduction   Hum an motor control involves  complex interactio ns  between the neural control signals , biomechanical  properties of the limbs , and external forces  such as  gravity  [1]. Movement in microgravity poses unique  challenges especially for  highly skilled manual tasks   that requir e control of devices  or manipulation of  objects  with complex dynami cs. We know  that human  sensorimotor performan ce can deteriorate  by as much as  50% at the initial onset of exposure to a microgravity  environment.  The velocity  trajector ies and muscl e  activity  of reaching  movements  are mildly affected  in  the short -term exposure to mi crogravity and  hypergravity , chan ges that  can quickly resolve  [2], [3] .  However , highly skilled  movements , like surgical  suturing , were  associated with greater  deficits  in  microgravity . This results  in increased  applied forces  and decrea sed accuracy and ef ficiency of movement  compared to the perform ance in normal  gravity  [4]–[6].  Therefore, understanding how the nervous system   compensates for the complex limb a nd object dynamics   in skilled  movements  will hel p us quantify the  performance deficits in microgravity and find methods  to mi tigate them.   The most accepted theory in  the field of  motor  control that explains how our brains  compensate  for  complex limb and external dynamics  is based on  the  idea of in ternal  model s [7]–[14]. The internal models  assist in the generation of co ntrol signals and provide  reference for the expec ted sensory feedback to de tect  mismat ch. For examp le, fo rward models  can compute  propriocepti ve feedback originating in muscle spindles  and Golgi tendon organ s from the efferen t copy of the  motor command . Th e mis match between sensed and  predicted signals can initiate a  sensorimoto r adaptati on  to improve  task performance  [15]. Conversely, inverse  models implement  desired consequences into actions ,  constraining  the outcome of control solut ions. These  models are optimized  through  the lifetime of  motor  learning  to perform  in the Earth’s gravita tional  environment . Therefore , the deficit  of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between the  interna l neural expectati ons of the forces caused by  gravity acting on  the limb d uring movemen t and object  manip ulation an d the  lack o f those forces in  microgravity .

Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2. Material and methods    2.1 Experimental  Procedure   Seve n healthy participant s (27.4 ± 4.6 years, 5  males) were recruited for this study. The study protocol   was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  West Virginia University (Protocol  #1311129283 ).  Participant s were include d if they presen ted no s erious disea se or d isorder that could af fect mo vements of the  arm and d id not consu me any medication that could  affect movements of the arm. All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task. In the left panel, t he participa nt is  seated and wearing a VR helmet. Black boxes on the  arm are wirel ess EMG sensors. The VR view in the  right panel shows the green block about to be placed on  the target (black circle with red cr oss).73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 3 of 9   The physical  BBT  was also built using the  specifie d  dimensions  (Fig. 2). To match the VR task  and  minimize inter -trial and int er-participant  variability , the  real-world BBT was also simplified to picki ng up a  single  3D-printed  block , which was  instrument ed with a  force sensor  (FSR , Trigno by Delsys ) for the detect ion  of contac t forces . Participants were  asked to pick up the  block , move it from left to right over the div iding  wall,  place it on the other side of the bo x, then move it back ,  and repeat this  20 times. During each  placement,  participan ts were as ked to a im for to the  same location   on the  table . Participants  performed the task twice –  once with a light block ( 0.02 kg, Light task ) and on ce  with a heavy block ( 0.11 kg, Heavy task).      Fig. 2. Experimental  Setup of the physical BBT . The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant . A repeated -measures ANOVA  was applied  to the dataset usin g the fitrm () in MATLAB . The model  contained  one within -subject fac tor (Gender)  and one  between subject factor  (Task with 3 l evels for VR,  Light, and Heavy  tasks). A separate  repeated-measures   ANOVA  with the same structure  was applied  to the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Post-hoc t ests between the  levels of the Ta sk factor  were conducted using the  multcompa re() in MATLAB  and comp ared with  the  Sidak -Bonferoni corr ection for multiple comparison s (  = 0.017 ).  The data in Resul ts are reported as  means  per task    standard deviations  across  participants  unless otherwise  indicated .    4. Resul ts   All p articipants  succeeded  in perform ing the three tasks  in a consistent mann er. During the physical BBT task,  the force sensors  provided reliable timing of grasp and  release of the block by the particip ants (Fig. 3A ). There  were no differen ces between  the level s of grip force   between the H eavy task (8  7 % max pressure)  and the  Light task (8  9 % max pressure ; t = 0.18, p = 0.87).  All recorded  movements  were  accompanied by  contractions of both flexors and extensors  of the hand   (Fig. 3B) . Muscle activations were  generall y lower  during  the VR task with no physical block to  manipula te, which  trans lated to lower co-contraction  values  (Fig. 3C, black line ). During the Light and Heavy  tasks,  the EMG activ ity of both flexors and extensors   increase d comp ared to the VR task . This resulted in  increased  co-contra ction values during the Light  and  Heavy tasks compare d to the VR task (Fig. 3C , blue and  red). This pattern was consistent across all participants   despite the high inter -subject variab ility in the levels of  individual  co-contraction  estimate s across tasks (Fig. 4).       Fig. 3.

Fig. 4. Co-contraction between  FCR and ECR  muscles   per task  for eac h participant . Coloured bars show   average s and whiskers  show st andard dev iations  across  20 block trans fers in each task. The co-contrac tion  between  FCR and ECR  muscles  was al ways the lowest  in the VR task in all participan ts.     This pattern was also consi stent across all muscle  pairs studied here , even in the bice ps and tric eps  muscles that  do not sp an the wrist and fi ngers and  are  typically thought to not be involved in object  manipulation directly  (Fig. 5). Overall , the co- contraction levels were diffe rent across conditions for  all antagonistic muscle pair combin ations ( F(1,1) = 25.4,  p = 0.004 ). There were no differe nces between  participants  of different gender  (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.471 ),  although the participant  pool was small.  The co- contraction  value s during the  VR task were  the lowest  in all pairs of muscl es (Fig. 5; Heavy – VR = 0.0 46   0.009, p = 0.008, significa ntly differe nt). The co- contraction val ues during the Light task were  most often  intermediate betwee n Heavy  and VR tasks , so that the re  were  no significan t difference s between these  tasks  across all m uscle pairs  and participants ( Light  – VR =  0.039   0.010 , p = 0.023 ; Light – Heavy = -0.006   0.007 , p = 0.613 ).   Similar  results were a lso obtai ned using t he total co- contractio n metric  (Fig. 6). The total co -contraction  between all flexors and extensors was differe nt across  tasks  (F(1,1) = 23.8, p = 0.005), but not across genders73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.   Copyri ght ©20 22 by the Internation al Astronautical Federation  (IAF) . All right s reserved.   IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 5 of 9 (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.47 0). The total co-contract ion levels  during the  VR task were  the lowest in all individuals   (Fig. 6; Heavy – VR = 0.010  0.002, p = 0.017,  significantly dif ferent). During the  Light task , the total  co-contract ion levels  were intermediate  (Light  – VR =  0.007  0.002, p = 0.02 9; Light  – Heavy  = -0.002   0.001, p = 0.286). Overall, th ese data shows that  the co - contraction of antagonistic muscles changes the most   when a physical object is present . It is also sensitive  to  the weight of the object being manipulated , but to a  lesser degree .    5. Discussion    Results show  that the co-contraction levels  of all  pairs of antagonistic muscle s and between  all flexors  and ext ensors  were  the highest  in the task with the  heav iest object and they were the lowest  in the  VR task.  This was contrary to the expectations of higher co - contractio n levels in the VR and Light task s. Thi s may  be due to the incorrect assumption  that the move ments  with lighter objects  or with no objects  are inhere ntly  less stable than the movements with the heav ier objects .  The validity of this assumption will be teste d in future  studies evaluating  how the interaction torques are  altered by the object  weig ht. Movements with a ssistive  interacti on torques , which  amplify the muscle torques  that cause  movement , have been shown to be  accompanied by increased co -contraction [41], [42] . It  is possible that objects with heavier  weight may further  amplify the assistive interactio n torques , and t hus  require increased co -contraction.  This idea, if true,  may  have  an interesting applicatio n for mainta ining  muscle  function while living and  working in microgravity . For  example, making  objects  that the astronauts  interact  with daily  heavier may increase  their muscle co - contraction and help reduce muscle  and bone wasting in  microgravity.    Our data also show that  movements in VR with no  physical  object  were accompanied  by consistent ly lower  co-contrac tion compared to  that during  movements w ith  real objects . While the visual feedback  was alike  during   the VR and real-world task s, the proprioceptive  and  haptic  feedba ck was clearly different .  We know that  both vision and proprioception  are important  for  defining the amplitude and direction of  reaching  [43]– [45] and for hand pre -shaping prior to object grasp [46],  [47]. Other c lassical studies with people who lost large- fibre  afferent feedback have shown that moveme nts  under only visu al control are slower and less accurate   [48], [49]  and that the muscle contractions are  sustainable  only with visual fee dback  [50]. Furthermore,  the corticosp inal control of hand  muscles is increased  around the time of object c ontact [51].  More r ecently, it  has been shown that t he alteration of sensory feedba ck  through  media n nerve paresthaesia  in healthy  participants  alters both  the reaching  for the object  and the grasping  forces  during object ma nipulation  [52].  Conversely,  the presence of haptic  feedback  in VR tasks   has been shown to strengthen  the perception of  immersive ness when compared to visual feedback alone   [53], [54] . This suggests that the reduced co -contraction  during our VR task may be due to  the altered   propri ocept ive feedbac k from the  missing  object weight   and the missing  haptic feedback from the contact with  the object . Therefore,  the training  in virtual re ality may  be more effective with better  carry over to the real - world skills when it is supplemented  with appropriate  haptic feedback  and potentially proprioceptive fee dback  through the use of robotic  exoskeletons  that would  simulate the changes in loads expected from the altered  gravity environment .

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 6 of 9 A limitation of the study is the simple  method we  used to estimate  joint stiffness . This method  is adequate   for determining the relative changes in  co-contraction  between ant agonistic muscles  across tasks  that are  indicative of the re lative changes in muscle  recruitment   driven by the nervous system . However, this meth od  does not  take into account  the force -length  and f orce- velocity  properties of the muscles  and the changes in   moment arm s of these muscles  that determine  the  contrib ution of each muscle ’s force to the joint  moment  and stiffness . We plan to leverage a  musculoskeletal   dynamic model of the arm  in future studi es to improve   on the method of calculating  limb stiffness and  to test  the generali ty of our conclusions .    6. Concl usions    To a ddress a broad  question of how  the nervous   system  compensates for gravity  during performance of  skilled tasks  we conducted a  pilot study investig ating   how the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the  neuromusc ular activity  of the arm . Results show that the  co-contraction levels increased  in the task with the  heavy object  and decreased in the  virtual  task with no  object . These data suggests  that the  internal expectatio ns  of the object weight an d the  propriocept ive and haptic  feedback from  the physica l object are driving the co- contraction of antagonistic muscles .       Fig. 6. Co-contraction between  all flexor and extensor   muscle s per task  for each partici pant. Coloured bars  show  average s and whiskers  show sta ndard d eviations   across 20 block  trans fers in each task. The total co- contrac tion was al ways the lowest in the VR task  in all  participants.   This supports the idea that  the nervous system  controls  limb stiffness through  muscle co -contraction to  compensate for expected  forces acting on th e limb . This  further suggests  that the loss of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between  these interna l neural expe ctations of the forces  experienced  during movement in normal  gravity and the  differen t forces  perceived through  altered sensory  feedback  in microgravity .

Introduction   Hum an motor control involves  complex interactio ns  between the neural control signals , biomechanical  properties of the limbs , and external forces  such as  gravity  [1]. Movement in microgravity poses unique  challenges especially for  highly skilled manual tasks   that requir e control of devices  or manipulation of  objects  with complex dynami cs. We know  that human  sensorimotor performan ce can deteriorate  by as much as  50% at the initial onset of exposure to a microgravity  environment.  The velocity  trajector ies and muscl e  activity  of reaching  movements  are mildly affected  in  the short -term exposure to mi crogravity and  hypergravity , chan ges that  can quickly resolve  [2], [3] .  However , highly skilled  movements , like surgical  suturing , were  associated with greater  deficits  in  microgravity . This results  in increased  applied forces  and decrea sed accuracy and ef ficiency of movement  compared to the perform ance in normal  gravity  [4]–[6].  Therefore, understanding how the nervous system   compensates for the complex limb a nd object dynamics   in skilled  movements  will hel p us quantify the  performance deficits in microgravity and find methods  to mi tigate them.   The most accepted theory in  the field of  motor  control that explains how our brains  compensate  for  complex limb and external dynamics  is based on  the  idea of in ternal  model s [7]–[14]. The internal models  assist in the generation of co ntrol signals and provide  reference for the expec ted sensory feedback to de tect  mismat ch. For examp le, fo rward models  can compute  propriocepti ve feedback originating in muscle spindles  and Golgi tendon organ s from the efferen t copy of the  motor command . Th e mis match between sensed and  predicted signals can initiate a  sensorimoto r adaptati on  to improve  task performance  [15]. Conversely, inverse  models implement  desired consequences into actions ,  constraining  the outcome of control solut ions. These  models are optimized  through  the lifetime of  motor  learning  to perform  in the Earth’s gravita tional  environment . Therefore , the deficit  of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between the  interna l neural expectati ons of the forces caused by  gravity acting on  the limb d uring movemen t and object  manip ulation an d the  lack o f those forces in  microgravity . Here , we conducted a pilot study of how  the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2. Material and methods    2.1 Experimental  Procedure   Seve n healthy participant s (27.4 ± 4.6 years, 5  males) were recruited for this study. The study protocol   was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  West Virginia University (Protocol  #1311129283 ).  Participant s were include d if they presen ted no s erious disea se or d isorder that could af fect mo vements of the  arm and d id not consu me any medication that could  affect movements of the arm. All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task. In the left panel, t he participa nt is  seated and wearing a VR helmet. Black boxes on the  arm are wirel ess EMG sensors. The VR view in the  right panel shows the green block about to be placed on  the target (black circle with red cr oss).73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 3 of 9   The physical  BBT  was also built using the  specifie d  dimensions  (Fig. 2). To match the VR task  and  minimize inter -trial and int er-participant  variability , the  real-world BBT was also simplified to picki ng up a  single  3D-printed  block , which was  instrument ed with a  force sensor  (FSR , Trigno by Delsys ) for the detect ion  of contac t forces . Participants were  asked to pick up the  block , move it from left to right over the div iding  wall,  place it on the other side of the bo x, then move it back ,  and repeat this  20 times. During each  placement,  participan ts were as ked to a im for to the  same location   on the  table . Participants  performed the task twice –  once with a light block ( 0.02 kg, Light task ) and on ce  with a heavy block ( 0.11 kg, Heavy task).      Fig. 2. Experimental  Setup of the physical BBT . The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant . A repeated -measures ANOVA  was applied  to the dataset usin g the fitrm () in MATLAB . The model  contained  one within -subject fac tor (Gender)  and one  between subject factor  (Task with 3 l evels for VR,  Light, and Heavy  tasks). A separate  repeated-measures   ANOVA  with the same structure  was applied  to the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Post-hoc t ests between the  levels of the Ta sk factor  were conducted using the  multcompa re() in MATLAB  and comp ared with  the  Sidak -Bonferoni corr ection for multiple comparison s (  = 0.017 ).  The data in Resul ts are reported as  means  per task    standard deviations  across  participants  unless otherwise  indicated .    4. Resul ts   All p articipants  succeeded  in perform ing the three tasks  in a consistent mann er. During the physical BBT task,  the force sensors  provided reliable timing of grasp and  release of the block by the particip ants (Fig. 3A ). There  were no differen ces between  the level s of grip force   between the H eavy task (8  7 % max pressure)  and the  Light task (8  9 % max pressure ; t = 0.18, p = 0.87).  All recorded  movements  were  accompanied by  contractions of both flexors and extensors  of the hand   (Fig. 3B) . Muscle activations were  generall y lower  during  the VR task with no physical block to  manipula te, which  trans lated to lower co-contraction  values  (Fig. 3C, black line ). During the Light and Heavy  tasks,  the EMG activ ity of both flexors and extensors   increase d comp ared to the VR task . This resulted in  increased  co-contra ction values during the Light  and  Heavy tasks compare d to the VR task (Fig. 3C , blue and  red). This pattern was consistent across all participants   despite the high inter -subject variab ility in the levels of  individual  co-contraction  estimate s across tasks (Fig. 4).       Fig. 3.

Coloured  lines show   the filtered profiles for  one of the  force sensors  located on the block  (A), rectified EMG  envelopes  of ECU and  FCU muscles  (B), and co-contraction between them (C)   during each task condit ion.     Fig. 4. Co-contraction between  FCR and ECR  muscles   per task  for eac h participant . Coloured bars show   average s and whiskers  show st andard dev iations  across  20 block trans fers in each task. The co-contrac tion  between  FCR and ECR  muscles  was al ways the lowest  in the VR task in all participan ts.     This pattern was also consi stent across all muscle  pairs studied here , even in the bice ps and tric eps  muscles that  do not sp an the wrist and fi ngers and  are  typically thought to not be involved in object  manipulation directly  (Fig. 5). Overall , the co- contraction levels were diffe rent across conditions for  all antagonistic muscle pair combin ations ( F(1,1) = 25.4,  p = 0.004 ). There were no differe nces between  participants  of different gender  (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.471 ),  although the participant  pool was small.  The co- contraction  value s during the  VR task were  the lowest  in all pairs of muscl es (Fig. 5; Heavy – VR = 0.0 46   0.009, p = 0.008, significa ntly differe nt). The co- contraction val ues during the Light task were  most often  intermediate betwee n Heavy  and VR tasks , so that the re  were  no significan t difference s between these  tasks  across all m uscle pairs  and participants ( Light  – VR =  0.039   0.010 , p = 0.023 ; Light – Heavy = -0.006   0.007 , p = 0.613 ).   Similar  results were a lso obtai ned using t he total co- contractio n metric  (Fig. 6). The total co -contraction  between all flexors and extensors was differe nt across  tasks  (F(1,1) = 23.8, p = 0.005), but not across genders73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.   Copyri ght ©20 22 by the Internation al Astronautical Federation  (IAF) . All right s reserved.   IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 5 of 9 (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.47 0). The total co-contract ion levels  during the  VR task were  the lowest in all individuals   (Fig. 6; Heavy – VR = 0.010  0.002, p = 0.017,  significantly dif ferent). During the  Light task , the total  co-contract ion levels  were intermediate  (Light  – VR =  0.007  0.002, p = 0.02 9; Light  – Heavy  = -0.002   0.001, p = 0.286). Overall, th ese data shows that  the co - contraction of antagonistic muscles changes the most   when a physical object is present . It is also sensitive  to  the weight of the object being manipulated , but to a  lesser degree .    5. Discussion    Results show  that the co-contraction levels  of all  pairs of antagonistic muscle s and between  all flexors  and ext ensors  were  the highest  in the task with the  heav iest object and they were the lowest  in the  VR task.  This was contrary to the expectations of higher co - contractio n levels in the VR and Light task s. Thi s may  be due to the incorrect assumption  that the move ments  with lighter objects  or with no objects  are inhere ntly  less stable than the movements with the heav ier objects .  The validity of this assumption will be teste d in future  studies evaluating  how the interaction torques are  altered by the object  weig ht. Movements with a ssistive  interacti on torques , which  amplify the muscle torques  that cause  movement , have been shown to be  accompanied by increased co -contraction [41], [42] . It  is possible that objects with heavier  weight may further  amplify the assistive interactio n torques , and t hus  require increased co -contraction.  This idea, if true,  may  have  an interesting applicatio n for mainta ining  muscle  function while living and  working in microgravity . For  example, making  objects  that the astronauts  interact  with daily  heavier may increase  their muscle co - contraction and help reduce muscle  and bone wasting in  microgravity.    Our data also show that  movements in VR with no  physical  object  were accompanied  by consistent ly lower  co-contrac tion compared to  that during  movements w ith  real objects . While the visual feedback  was alike  during   the VR and real-world task s, the proprioceptive  and  haptic  feedba ck was clearly different .  We know that  both vision and proprioception  are important  for  defining the amplitude and direction of  reaching  [43]– [45] and for hand pre -shaping prior to object grasp [46],  [47]. Other c lassical studies with people who lost large- fibre  afferent feedback have shown that moveme nts  under only visu al control are slower and less accurate   [48], [49]  and that the muscle contractions are  sustainable  only with visual fee dback  [50]. Furthermore,  the corticosp inal control of hand  muscles is increased  around the time of object c ontact [51].  More r ecently, it  has been shown that t he alteration of sensory feedba ck  through  media n nerve paresthaesia  in healthy  participants  alters both  the reaching  for the object  and the grasping  forces  during object ma nipulation  [52].  Conversely,  the presence of haptic  feedback  in VR tasks   has been shown to strengthen  the perception of  immersive ness when compared to visual feedback alone   [53], [54] . This suggests that the reduced co -contraction  during our VR task may be due to  the altered   propri ocept ive feedbac k from the  missing  object weight   and the missing  haptic feedback from the contact with  the object . Therefore,  the training  in virtual re ality may  be more effective with better  carry over to the real - world skills when it is supplemented  with appropriate  haptic feedback  and potentially proprioceptive fee dback  through the use of robotic  exoskeletons  that would  simulate the changes in loads expected from the altered  gravity environment .

Coloured  bars show m eans across  participants.  The co-contrac tion between all muscle  pairs , except with APB, was the lowest in the VR t ask  in most  participants.73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.   Copyri ght ©20 22 by the Internation al Astronautical Federation  (IAF) . All right s reserved.   IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 6 of 9 A limitation of the study is the simple  method we  used to estimate  joint stiffness . This method  is adequate   for determining the relative changes in  co-contraction  between ant agonistic muscles  across tasks  that are  indicative of the re lative changes in muscle  recruitment   driven by the nervous system . However, this meth od  does not  take into account  the force -length  and f orce- velocity  properties of the muscles  and the changes in   moment arm s of these muscles  that determine  the  contrib ution of each muscle ’s force to the joint  moment  and stiffness . We plan to leverage a  musculoskeletal   dynamic model of the arm  in future studi es to improve   on the method of calculating  limb stiffness and  to test  the generali ty of our conclusions .    6. Concl usions    To a ddress a broad  question of how  the nervous   system  compensates for gravity  during performance of  skilled tasks  we conducted a  pilot study investig ating   how the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the  neuromusc ular activity  of the arm . Results show that the  co-contraction levels increased  in the task with the  heavy object  and decreased in the  virtual  task with no  object . These data suggests  that the  internal expectatio ns  of the object weight an d the  propriocept ive and haptic  feedback from  the physica l object are driving the co- contraction of antagonistic muscles .       Fig. 6. Co-contraction between  all flexor and extensor   muscle s per task  for each partici pant. Coloured bars  show  average s and whiskers  show sta ndard d eviations   across 20 block  trans fers in each task. The total co- contrac tion was al ways the lowest in the VR task  in all  participants.   This supports the idea that  the nervous system  controls  limb stiffness through  muscle co -contraction to  compensate for expected  forces acting on th e limb . This  further suggests  that the loss of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between  these interna l neural expe ctations of the forces  experienced  during movement in normal  gravity and the  differen t forces  perceived through  altered sensory  feedback  in microgravity .

Introduction   Hum an motor control involves  complex interactio ns  between the neural control signals , biomechanical  properties of the limbs , and external forces  such as  gravity  [1]. Movement in microgravity poses unique  challenges especially for  highly skilled manual tasks   that requir e control of devices  or manipulation of  objects  with complex dynami cs. We know  that human  sensorimotor performan ce can deteriorate  by as much as  50% at the initial onset of exposure to a microgravity  environment.  The velocity  trajector ies and muscl e  activity  of reaching  movements  are mildly affected  in  the short -term exposure to mi crogravity and  hypergravity , chan ges that  can quickly resolve  [2], [3] .  However , highly skilled  movements , like surgical  suturing , were  associated with greater  deficits  in  microgravity . This results  in increased  applied forces  and decrea sed accuracy and ef ficiency of movement  compared to the perform ance in normal  gravity  [4]–[6].  Therefore, understanding how the nervous system   compensates for the complex limb a nd object dynamics   in skilled  movements  will hel p us quantify the  performance deficits in microgravity and find methods  to mi tigate them.   The most accepted theory in  the field of  motor  control that explains how our brains  compensate  for  complex limb and external dynamics  is based on  the  idea of in ternal  model s [7]–[14]. The internal models  assist in the generation of co ntrol signals and provide  reference for the expec ted sensory feedback to de tect  mismat ch. For examp le, fo rward models  can compute  propriocepti ve feedback originating in muscle spindles  and Golgi tendon organ s from the efferen t copy of the  motor command . Th e mis match between sensed and  predicted signals can initiate a  sensorimoto r adaptati on  to improve  task performance  [15]. Conversely, inverse  models implement  desired consequences into actions ,  constraining  the outcome of control solut ions. These  models are optimized  through  the lifetime of  motor  learning  to perform  in the Earth’s gravita tional  environment . Therefore , the deficit  of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between the  interna l neural expectati ons of the forces caused by  gravity acting on  the limb d uring movemen t and object  manip ulation an d the  lack o f those forces in  microgravity . Here , we conducted a pilot study of how  the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 2 of 9 neuromusc ular activity  of the arm  to shed light on  the  larger question of  how the nervous  system  compensates  for g ravity  during performance of skilled tasks .  Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2. Material and methods    2.1 Experimental  Procedure   Seve n healthy participant s (27.4 ± 4.6 years, 5  males) were recruited for this study. The study protocol   was approved by the Institutional Review Board of  West Virginia University (Protocol  #1311129283 ).  Participant s were include d if they presen ted no s erious disea se or d isorder that could af fect mo vements of the  arm and d id not consu me any medication that could  affect movements of the arm. All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task. In the left panel, t he participa nt is  seated and wearing a VR helmet. Black boxes on the  arm are wirel ess EMG sensors. The VR view in the  right panel shows the green block about to be placed on  the target (black circle with red cr oss).73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 3 of 9   The physical  BBT  was also built using the  specifie d  dimensions  (Fig. 2). To match the VR task  and  minimize inter -trial and int er-participant  variability , the  real-world BBT was also simplified to picki ng up a  single  3D-printed  block , which was  instrument ed with a  force sensor  (FSR , Trigno by Delsys ) for the detect ion  of contac t forces . Participants were  asked to pick up the  block , move it from left to right over the div iding  wall,  place it on the other side of the bo x, then move it back ,  and repeat this  20 times. During each  placement,  participan ts were as ked to a im for to the  same location   on the  table . Participants  performed the task twice –  once with a light block ( 0.02 kg, Light task ) and on ce  with a heavy block ( 0.11 kg, Heavy task).      Fig. 2. Experimental  Setup of the physical BBT . The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant . A repeated -measures ANOVA  was applied  to the dataset usin g the fitrm () in MATLAB . The model  contained  one within -subject fac tor (Gender)  and one  between subject factor  (Task with 3 l evels for VR,  Light, and Heavy  tasks). A separate  repeated-measures   ANOVA  with the same structure  was applied  to the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Post-hoc t ests between the  levels of the Ta sk factor  were conducted using the  multcompa re() in MATLAB  and comp ared with  the  Sidak -Bonferoni corr ection for multiple comparison s (  = 0.017 ).  The data in Resul ts are reported as  means  per task    standard deviations  across  participants  unless otherwise  indicated .    4. Resul ts   All p articipants  succeeded  in perform ing the three tasks  in a consistent mann er. During the physical BBT task,  the force sensors  provided reliable timing of grasp and  release of the block by the particip ants (Fig. 3A ). There  were no differen ces between  the level s of grip force   between the H eavy task (8  7 % max pressure)  and the  Light task (8  9 % max pressure ; t = 0.18, p = 0.87).  All recorded  movements  were  accompanied by  contractions of both flexors and extensors  of the hand   (Fig. 3B) . Muscle activations were  generall y lower  during  the VR task with no physical block to  manipula te, which  trans lated to lower co-contraction  values  (Fig. 3C, black line ). During the Light and Heavy  tasks,  the EMG activ ity of both flexors and extensors   increase d comp ared to the VR task . This resulted in  increased  co-contra ction values during the Light  and  Heavy tasks compare d to the VR task (Fig. 3C , blue and  red). This pattern was consistent across all participants   despite the high inter -subject variab ility in the levels of  individual  co-contraction  estimate s across tasks (Fig. 4).       Fig. 3.

Coloured  lines show   the filtered profiles for  one of the  force sensors  located on the block  (A), rectified EMG  envelopes  of ECU and  FCU muscles  (B), and co-contraction between them (C)   during each task condit ion.     Fig. 4. Co-contraction between  FCR and ECR  muscles   per task  for eac h participant . Coloured bars show   average s and whiskers  show st andard dev iations  across  20 block trans fers in each task. The co-contrac tion  between  FCR and ECR  muscles  was al ways the lowest  in the VR task in all participan ts.     This pattern was also consi stent across all muscle  pairs studied here , even in the bice ps and tric eps  muscles that  do not sp an the wrist and fi ngers and  are  typically thought to not be involved in object  manipulation directly  (Fig. 5). Overall , the co- contraction levels were diffe rent across conditions for  all antagonistic muscle pair combin ations ( F(1,1) = 25.4,  p = 0.004 ). There were no differe nces between  participants  of different gender  (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.471 ),  although the participant  pool was small.  The co- contraction  value s during the  VR task were  the lowest  in all pairs of muscl es (Fig. 5; Heavy – VR = 0.0 46   0.009, p = 0.008, significa ntly differe nt). The co- contraction val ues during the Light task were  most often  intermediate betwee n Heavy  and VR tasks , so that the re  were  no significan t difference s between these  tasks  across all m uscle pairs  and participants ( Light  – VR =  0.039   0.010 , p = 0.023 ; Light – Heavy = -0.006   0.007 , p = 0.613 ).   Similar  results were a lso obtai ned using t he total co- contractio n metric  (Fig. 6). The total co -contraction  between all flexors and extensors was differe nt across  tasks  (F(1,1) = 23.8, p = 0.005), but not across genders73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

The total co-contract ion levels  during the  VR task were  the lowest in all individuals   (Fig. 6; Heavy – VR = 0.010  0.002, p = 0.017,  significantly dif ferent). During the  Light task , the total  co-contract ion levels  were intermediate  (Light  – VR =  0.007  0.002, p = 0.02 9; Light  – Heavy  = -0.002   0.001, p = 0.286). Overall, th ese data shows that  the co - contraction of antagonistic muscles changes the most   when a physical object is present . It is also sensitive  to  the weight of the object being manipulated , but to a  lesser degree .    5. Discussion    Results show  that the co-contraction levels  of all  pairs of antagonistic muscle s and between  all flexors  and ext ensors  were  the highest  in the task with the  heav iest object and they were the lowest  in the  VR task.  This was contrary to the expectations of higher co - contractio n levels in the VR and Light task s. Thi s may  be due to the incorrect assumption  that the move ments  with lighter objects  or with no objects  are inhere ntly  less stable than the movements with the heav ier objects .  The validity of this assumption will be teste d in future  studies evaluating  how the interaction torques are  altered by the object  weig ht. Movements with a ssistive  interacti on torques , which  amplify the muscle torques  that cause  movement , have been shown to be  accompanied by increased co -contraction [41], [42] . It  is possible that objects with heavier  weight may further  amplify the assistive interactio n torques , and t hus  require increased co -contraction.  This idea, if true,  may  have  an interesting applicatio n for mainta ining  muscle  function while living and  working in microgravity . For  example, making  objects  that the astronauts  interact  with daily  heavier may increase  their muscle co - contraction and help reduce muscle  and bone wasting in  microgravity.    Our data also show that  movements in VR with no  physical  object  were accompanied  by consistent ly lower  co-contrac tion compared to  that during  movements w ith  real objects . While the visual feedback  was alike  during   the VR and real-world task s, the proprioceptive  and  haptic  feedba ck was clearly different .  We know that  both vision and proprioception  are important  for  defining the amplitude and direction of  reaching  [43]– [45] and for hand pre -shaping prior to object grasp [46],  [47]. Other c lassical studies with people who lost large- fibre  afferent feedback have shown that moveme nts  under only visu al control are slower and less accurate   [48], [49]  and that the muscle contractions are  sustainable  only with visual fee dback  [50]. Furthermore,  the corticosp inal control of hand  muscles is increased  around the time of object c ontact [51].  More r ecently, it  has been shown that t he alteration of sensory feedba ck  through  media n nerve paresthaesia  in healthy  participants  alters both  the reaching  for the object  and the grasping  forces  during object ma nipulation  [52].  Conversely,  the presence of haptic  feedback  in VR tasks   has been shown to strengthen  the perception of  immersive ness when compared to visual feedback alone   [53], [54] . This suggests that the reduced co -contraction  during our VR task may be due to  the altered   propri ocept ive feedbac k from the  missing  object weight   and the missing  haptic feedback from the contact with  the object . Therefore,  the training  in virtual re ality may  be more effective with better  carry over to the real - world skills when it is supplemented  with appropriate  haptic feedback  and potentially proprioceptive fee dback  through the use of robotic  exoskeletons  that would  simulate the changes in loads expected from the altered  gravity environment .

This method  is adequate   for determining the relative changes in  co-contraction  between ant agonistic muscles  across tasks  that are  indicative of the re lative changes in muscle  recruitment   driven by the nervous system . However, this meth od  does not  take into account  the force -length  and f orce- velocity  properties of the muscles  and the changes in   moment arm s of these muscles  that determine  the  contrib ution of each muscle ’s force to the joint  moment  and stiffness . We plan to leverage a  musculoskeletal   dynamic model of the arm  in future studi es to improve   on the method of calculating  limb stiffness and  to test  the generali ty of our conclusions .    6. Concl usions    To a ddress a broad  question of how  the nervous   system  compensates for gravity  during performance of  skilled tasks  we conducted a  pilot study investig ating   how the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the  neuromusc ular activity  of the arm . Results show that the  co-contraction levels increased  in the task with the  heavy object  and decreased in the  virtual  task with no  object . These data suggests  that the  internal expectatio ns  of the object weight an d the  propriocept ive and haptic  feedback from  the physica l object are driving the co- contraction of antagonistic muscles .       Fig. 6. Co-contraction between  all flexor and extensor   muscle s per task  for each partici pant. Coloured bars  show  average s and whiskers  show sta ndard d eviations   across 20 block  trans fers in each task. The total co- contrac tion was al ways the lowest in the VR task  in all  participants.   This supports the idea that  the nervous system  controls  limb stiffness through  muscle co -contraction to  compensate for expected  forces acting on th e limb . This  further suggests  that the loss of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between  these interna l neural expe ctations of the forces  experienced  during movement in normal  gravity and the  differen t forces  perceived through  altered sensory  feedback  in microgravity .

Introduction   Hum an motor control involves  complex interactio ns  between the neural control signals , biomechanical  properties of the limbs , and external forces  such as  gravity  [1]. Movement in microgravity poses unique  challenges especially for  highly skilled manual tasks   that requir e control of devices  or manipulation of  objects  with complex dynami cs. We know  that human  sensorimotor performan ce can deteriorate  by as much as  50% at the initial onset of exposure to a microgravity  environment.  The velocity  trajector ies and muscl e  activity  of reaching  movements  are mildly affected  in  the short -term exposure to mi crogravity and  hypergravity , chan ges that  can quickly resolve  [2], [3] .  However , highly skilled  movements , like surgical  suturing , were  associated with greater  deficits  in  microgravity . This results  in increased  applied forces  and decrea sed accuracy and ef ficiency of movement  compared to the perform ance in normal  gravity  [4]–[6].  Therefore, understanding how the nervous system   compensates for the complex limb a nd object dynamics   in skilled  movements  will hel p us quantify the  performance deficits in microgravity and find methods  to mi tigate them.   The most accepted theory in  the field of  motor  control that explains how our brains  compensate  for  complex limb and external dynamics  is based on  the  idea of in ternal  model s [7]–[14]. The internal models  assist in the generation of co ntrol signals and provide  reference for the expec ted sensory feedback to de tect  mismat ch. For examp le, fo rward models  can compute  propriocepti ve feedback originating in muscle spindles  and Golgi tendon organ s from the efferen t copy of the  motor command . Th e mis match between sensed and  predicted signals can initiate a  sensorimoto r adaptati on  to improve  task performance  [15]. Conversely, inverse  models implement  desired consequences into actions ,  constraining  the outcome of control solut ions. These  models are optimized  through  the lifetime of  motor  learning  to perform  in the Earth’s gravita tional  environment . Therefore , the deficit  of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between the  interna l neural expectati ons of the forces caused by  gravity acting on  the limb d uring movemen t and object  manip ulation an d the  lack o f those forces in  microgravity . Here , we conducted a pilot study of how  the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 2 of 9 neuromusc ular activity  of the arm  to shed light on  the  larger question of  how the nervous  system  compensates  for g ravity  during performance of skilled tasks .  Any movement can be produced by multiple  combinations of joint trajectories  driven by an even  larger number of muscle activation  combina tions , a  problem of redun dancy  [16]. However,  adding stiff ness  to the set of  control parameters used by the nervous  system   can constrain the space of control solutions  and  ensure stable execution  of movement  in presenc e of  unanticipated externa l forces  [17]–[19]. This suggests  that h igher stiffness  is observed when movement  stabil ity is  challenged , such as in a microgravity  environment . The stiffness con trol is acco mplished  through the co-contraction  of antagonistic pairs of  muscles , for example, flexors and extensors of the wrist   [20]. The amount of muscle co -activation increases in  movements with unstable loads compared to those with  stable loads  [21]–[23]. Increased  stiffness  of the whole  limb has also been shown to s tabilize movement in  nove l dynamical tasks  [24]. Wrist stiffness has also  been rep orted to inc rease during  unstable dynamical  loads compared to stable loads  [25] and when the  accuracy deman ds of the task are higher  [26]. Here, we   test the importance  of stiffnes s for maintaining  wrist   stability  and compensating for object weight  by  manipulati ng of the weight of  the object , from no object  in virtual reality  (VR) task (0 g) to light  (20 g) and  heavy  (100 g ) objects  in real-world  tasks. We  hypothesize d that movements  performed with li ghter  objects or without object s in VR are more unstable than  movements with heavi er objects , causing higher levels  of co-contraction during the former compared to the  latter .   VR is a valuable tool to  facilitate  skill acqu isition   and rehab ilitation  [27]–[34]. For example , the  implementation  of hand trackin g enables  users to  interact with virtual  objects in the VR environment  and  potentially train to perform complex manual skills .  However, the objects are  “weightle ss”, which alters  both the propr ioceptive and the haptic fee dback  from  the muscles , tendons, joints, and skin  of the arm a nd  hand . From  evaluating the skill of  robotic sur gery we  know that the missing haptic feedback is likely the  culprit in the increased time to perform robotic surgery   [35]. Therefore,  it is imp ortant to understand  both the  benefits and limitat ions of  VR training  when preparing  for working in  altered gravity environments .    2.

All data acquisition   systems were synched in time using Dragonfly  real-time  messag ing architecture  [36].   2.1.1  Instrume ntation  After pro viding written informed  consent,  participan ts were instructed to sit in a  standard chair and  were instrumented with  wireless  EMG sensors (Trigno   by Delsys) . The sensors  were placed on  the following   muscle s on each participant ’s dominant a rm: extensor  pollicis bre vis (EPB) , abdu ctor pollicis brevis (APB) ;  flexor digitorum superf icialis (FDS ); extensor digitorum  communis (EDC) , flexor carpi ulnaris  (FCU) , flexor  carpi radialis (FCR) , extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) ,  extensor carpi radi alis (ECR ), anconeus (A NC), biceps   short  head (BicS) and long head  (BicL), triceps  longus   (TriLo), and triceps lateral (TriLa). All 7 subjects in this  study were right -arm dominant.   2.1.2 Tasks   During the  experiment participants  performed three  versions of the Box and Bl ock Test (BBT) . The BBT is   a clinical te st of manual dexterity oft en used in  clinica l  research  to ev aluate the  level o f sensorimotor  defici ts in  people with neur ological diso rders.  The first version  of  BBT , termed  VR task,  was performed in VR with no  real blocks  present  (Fig. 1). The virtual BBT was built  to match the  standard dimensions d escribed i n [37] and  textures mimic king the real -world setup . During this  task, participants  were  in an imme rsive,  first-person  user experience and able to interact with the block using  the virtual representation of their hand.  The VR task  was simplified to show a single block at  a time, which   the participants had to pick up with th eir dominant  right  arm an d move  from left to right over a barrier of the  standard dimensions  and place it on a target l ocated on  the other side of the barrier  (Fig. 1) . Once the block was  place d over  the target,  a new block appeared on the  oppos ite side indicating the start o f the next  trial. Once  20 blocks were moved, the t ask ended .  This simplified  version of BBT  standard ised the  direction  and extent  of  movement s across repetitions and participant s.         Fig. 1. VR task.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 3 of 9   The physical  BBT  was also built using the  specifie d  dimensions  (Fig. 2). To match the VR task  and  minimize inter -trial and int er-participant  variability , the  real-world BBT was also simplified to picki ng up a  single  3D-printed  block , which was  instrument ed with a  force sensor  (FSR , Trigno by Delsys ) for the detect ion  of contac t forces . Participants were  asked to pick up the  block , move it from left to right over the div iding  wall,  place it on the other side of the bo x, then move it back ,  and repeat this  20 times. During each  placement,  participan ts were as ked to a im for to the  same location   on the  table . Participants  performed the task twice –  once with a light block ( 0.02 kg, Light task ) and on ce  with a heavy block ( 0.11 kg, Heavy task).      Fig. 2. Experimental  Setup of the physical BBT . The  3D-printed block is white, the wire attached to it shows  the placement  of the force  sensors  on each side of the  block under the thumb and index fing er of the  participant .    2.3 Data Analysis    All data  analysi s was cond ucted using  MATLAB  version R2021b. Recorded timeser ies of EMG and force  were  imported  into a relational dat abase  with meta data  describing the  condition s during experimental sessions,  signal prope rties,  and participa nt demog raphics.  EMG  was high-pass filtered ( Butter worth , 5 Hz cut off  frequency) , rectified , and lo w-pass filtered (Butt erworth,  5 Hz cut  off freq uency) . The force si gnals  were low- pass filtered (Butterworth , 5 Hz cut off frequency) .    3. Theory  and analysis   Muscle recruitment was estimated from  the tempor al  profiles of EMG  using a  normaliz ation procedure.  A  peak  EMG of a given muscle was found a cross all  movements . Then,  EMG  profi les for each muscle  were  divided by their corresponding maximal  value. This  rescaled  the EMG profiles as a proportion of thei r  maximum co ntraction  and enabled the compa risons  betwe en the activation of  different muscles acros s  participant s.  Muscle contractio ns observ ed with EMG translate  into joint moments thro ugh moment a rms. These  moment arms have opp osite signs , designating m uscle   functi on, e.g.,  as either flexor  or extensor . When two or  more agonist ic muscles spanning  the same joint  contract  together, some or all of the moments  they produce  about  the join t cancel out . However, this co-contrac tion is  useful for motor contro l as it chan ges joint stiffness  and  viscosity . These biomechan ical aspects of muscle  function are thought  to contribute to  joint stabiliza tion  control led by the nervou s sys tem. Co-contraction  was  quantified  as the minimum valu e of normalized EMG   between  antagonistic m uscles  [38]–[40]:     CC(t) = min(EMG i(t),EMG j(t)),    (1)    where CC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, and EMG i(t)  or EMG j(t) are EMG profiles  of antagonistic muscles  or  muscle groups  i and j at the corresponding time  t. The  explored antagonistic muscle combinations  include  FCR -ECR , FCU -ECU, F DS-EDC, FCU -ECR, ECU - FCR, APB-FDS, APB -FCR, EPB-FDS, EPB-FCR ,  BicS-TriLa, and BicL -TriLo.  The minimum value of  contraction between each for these pairs of muscles  signifies the level of antagonistic  co-contraction  that is  indicative  of joint stiffness , i.e., higher level of co- contraction indicates higher stiffne ss of the joints that  these muscles span .   To estimate  the changes in the  whole -limb stiff ness  across the tasks,  another  co-contraction metric  was  calculated  between  summed normalized EM G of all  flexors (BicL, BicS , FCR,  FCU, and FDS) and that for  all extensors  (TriLo, TriLa,  ECR, ECU, ED C, EPB, and  APB) , so that     TCC(t) = min( sum( EMG i(t))/5,sum(EMG j(t))/7),  (2)    where TCC(t) is the co-contraction at time t, between  summed  EMG  of flexor s (i) and ex tenso rs (j) at the  corresponding time  t.  Statistical analysis was performed  on the contact  force and co-contr action  timeseries. The force   timeseries  were thresholded at mean value across  the 20  block  transfers  and all v alues above the mean were   averag ed per task per s ubject . These mean values per  subject were c ompared between Light and H eavy tasks  using a paired t -test using the ttest() in MATLAB.    The co -contraction  timeseries  were a lso averaged   across  20 block tran sfers for each muscle combin ation,  each task ( VR, Light  block , and Hea vy block), and each  participant . A repeated -measures ANOVA  was applied  to the dataset usin g the fitrm () in MATLAB . The model  contained  one within -subject fac tor (Gender)  and one  between subject factor  (Task with 3 l evels for VR,  Light, and Heavy  tasks). A separate  repeated-measures   ANOVA  with the same structure  was applied  to the73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

Post-hoc t ests between the  levels of the Ta sk factor  were conducted using the  multcompa re() in MATLAB  and comp ared with  the  Sidak -Bonferoni corr ection for multiple comparison s (  = 0.017 ).  The data in Resul ts are reported as  means  per task    standard deviations  across  participants  unless otherwise  indicated .    4. Resul ts   All p articipants  succeeded  in perform ing the three tasks  in a consistent mann er. During the physical BBT task,  the force sensors  provided reliable timing of grasp and  release of the block by the particip ants (Fig. 3A ). There  were no differen ces between  the level s of grip force   between the H eavy task (8  7 % max pressure)  and the  Light task (8  9 % max pressure ; t = 0.18, p = 0.87).  All recorded  movements  were  accompanied by  contractions of both flexors and extensors  of the hand   (Fig. 3B) . Muscle activations were  generall y lower  during  the VR task with no physical block to  manipula te, which  trans lated to lower co-contraction  values  (Fig. 3C, black line ). During the Light and Heavy  tasks,  the EMG activ ity of both flexors and extensors   increase d comp ared to the VR task . This resulted in  increased  co-contra ction values during the Light  and  Heavy tasks compare d to the VR task (Fig. 3C , blue and  red). This pattern was consistent across all participants   despite the high inter -subject variab ility in the levels of  individual  co-contraction  estimate s across tasks (Fig. 4).       Fig. 3.

Coloured  lines show   the filtered profiles for  one of the  force sensors  located on the block  (A), rectified EMG  envelopes  of ECU and  FCU muscles  (B), and co-contraction between them (C)   during each task condit ion.     Fig. 4. Co-contraction between  FCR and ECR  muscles   per task  for eac h participant . Coloured bars show   average s and whiskers  show st andard dev iations  across  20 block trans fers in each task. The co-contrac tion  between  FCR and ECR  muscles  was al ways the lowest  in the VR task in all participan ts.     This pattern was also consi stent across all muscle  pairs studied here , even in the bice ps and tric eps  muscles that  do not sp an the wrist and fi ngers and  are  typically thought to not be involved in object  manipulation directly  (Fig. 5). Overall , the co- contraction levels were diffe rent across conditions for  all antagonistic muscle pair combin ations ( F(1,1) = 25.4,  p = 0.004 ). There were no differe nces between  participants  of different gender  (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.471 ),  although the participant  pool was small.  The co- contraction  value s during the  VR task were  the lowest  in all pairs of muscl es (Fig. 5; Heavy – VR = 0.0 46   0.009, p = 0.008, significa ntly differe nt). The co- contraction val ues during the Light task were  most often  intermediate betwee n Heavy  and VR tasks , so that the re  were  no significan t difference s between these  tasks  across all m uscle pairs  and participants ( Light  – VR =  0.039   0.010 , p = 0.023 ; Light – Heavy = -0.006   0.007 , p = 0.613 ).   Similar  results were a lso obtai ned using t he total co- contractio n metric  (Fig. 6). The total co -contraction  between all flexors and extensors was differe nt across  tasks  (F(1,1) = 23.8, p = 0.005), but not across genders73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.   Copyri ght ©20 22 by the Internation al Astronautical Federation  (IAF) . All right s reserved.   IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 5 of 9 (F(1,1)  = 0.6, p = 0.47 0). The total co-contract ion levels  during the  VR task were  the lowest in all individuals   (Fig. 6; Heavy – VR = 0.010  0.002, p = 0.017,  significantly dif ferent). During the  Light task , the total  co-contract ion levels  were intermediate  (Light  – VR =  0.007  0.002, p = 0.02 9; Light  – Heavy  = -0.002   0.001, p = 0.286). Overall, th ese data shows that  the co - contraction of antagonistic muscles changes the most   when a physical object is present . It is also sensitive  to  the weight of the object being manipulated , but to a  lesser degree .    5. Discussion    Results show  that the co-contraction levels  of all  pairs of antagonistic muscle s and between  all flexors  and ext ensors  were  the highest  in the task with the  heav iest object and they were the lowest  in the  VR task.  This was contrary to the expectations of higher co - contractio n levels in the VR and Light task s. Thi s may  be due to the incorrect assumption  that the move ments  with lighter objects  or with no objects  are inhere ntly  less stable than the movements with the heav ier objects .  The validity of this assumption will be teste d in future  studies evaluating  how the interaction torques are  altered by the object  weig ht. Movements with a ssistive  interacti on torques , which  amplify the muscle torques  that cause  movement , have been shown to be  accompanied by increased co -contraction [41], [42] . It  is possible that objects with heavier  weight may further  amplify the assistive interactio n torques , and t hus  require increased co -contraction.  This idea, if true,  may  have  an interesting applicatio n for mainta ining  muscle  function while living and  working in microgravity . For  example, making  objects  that the astronauts  interact  with daily  heavier may increase  their muscle co - contraction and help reduce muscle  and bone wasting in  microgravity.    Our data also show that  movements in VR with no  physical  object  were accompanied  by consistent ly lower  co-contrac tion compared to  that during  movements w ith  real objects . While the visual feedback  was alike  during   the VR and real-world task s, the proprioceptive  and  haptic  feedba ck was clearly different .  We know that  both vision and proprioception  are important  for  defining the amplitude and direction of  reaching  [43]– [45] and for hand pre -shaping prior to object grasp [46],  [47]. Other c lassical studies with people who lost large- fibre  afferent feedback have shown that moveme nts  under only visu al control are slower and less accurate   [48], [49]  and that the muscle contractions are  sustainable  only with visual fee dback  [50]. Furthermore,  the corticosp inal control of hand  muscles is increased  around the time of object c ontact [51].  More r ecently, it  has been shown that t he alteration of sensory feedba ck  through  media n nerve paresthaesia  in healthy  participants  alters both  the reaching  for the object  and the grasping  forces  during object ma nipulation  [52].  Conversely,  the presence of haptic  feedback  in VR tasks   has been shown to strengthen  the perception of  immersive ness when compared to visual feedback alone   [53], [54] . This suggests that the reduced co -contraction  during our VR task may be due to  the altered   propri ocept ive feedbac k from the  missing  object weight   and the missing  haptic feedback from the contact with  the object . Therefore,  the training  in virtual re ality may  be more effective with better  carry over to the real - world skills when it is supplemented  with appropriate  haptic feedback  and potentially proprioceptive fee dback  through the use of robotic  exoskeletons  that would  simulate the changes in loads expected from the altered  gravity environment .

Coloured  bars show m eans across  participants.  The co-contrac tion between all muscle  pairs , except with APB, was the lowest in the VR t ask  in most  participants.73rd International Astronautical Congress  (IAC) , Paris, France , 18-22 September  2022.

IAC-22, A2, IP, x68484        Page 6 of 9 A limitation of the study is the simple  method we  used to estimate  joint stiffness . This method  is adequate   for determining the relative changes in  co-contraction  between ant agonistic muscles  across tasks  that are  indicative of the re lative changes in muscle  recruitment   driven by the nervous system . However, this meth od  does not  take into account  the force -length  and f orce- velocity  properties of the muscles  and the changes in   moment arm s of these muscles  that determine  the  contrib ution of each muscle ’s force to the joint  moment  and stiffness . We plan to leverage a  musculoskeletal   dynamic model of the arm  in future studi es to improve   on the method of calculating  limb stiffness and  to test  the generali ty of our conclusions .    6. Concl usions    To a ddress a broad  question of how  the nervous   system  compensates for gravity  during performance of  skilled tasks  we conducted a  pilot study investig ating   how the weight of the grasped  object is reflected in the  neuromusc ular activity  of the arm . Results show that the  co-contraction levels increased  in the task with the  heavy object  and decreased in the  virtual  task with no  object . These data suggests  that the  internal expectatio ns  of the object weight an d the  propriocept ive and haptic  feedback from  the physica l object are driving the co- contraction of antagonistic muscles .       Fig. 6. Co-contraction between  all flexor and extensor   muscle s per task  for each partici pant. Coloured bars  show  average s and whiskers  show sta ndard d eviations   across 20 block  trans fers in each task. The total co- contrac tion was al ways the lowest in the VR task  in all  participants.   This supports the idea that  the nervous system  controls  limb stiffness through  muscle co -contraction to  compensate for expected  forces acting on th e limb . This  further suggests  that the loss of performance  in  microgravity  is likely due to the mismatch between  these interna l neural expe ctations of the forces  experienced  during movement in normal  gravity and the  differen t forces  perceived through  altered sensory  feedback  in microgravity .
